# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Deep Learning
This project demonstrates handwritten digit recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the MNIST dataset. The model is built and trained in a Google Colab notebook, making it easy to experiment with and run.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify handwritten digits (0-9) using a CNN. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of 28x28 pixel grayscale handwritten digits.

The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and optimized for high accuracy. All steps, from data preprocessing to training and evaluation, are performed in a fully interactive Google Colab notebook, so you can quickly get started without any setup.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the MNIST dataset, which contains:

60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.

The images are 28x28 pixels and grayscale.

Google Colab File
The project includes a Google Colab notebook for easy execution. 

In the Colab notebook, youâ€™ll find sections for:

Data preprocessing and augmentation

Building and training the CNN model

Evaluating model performance

Making predictions on new images

Features
